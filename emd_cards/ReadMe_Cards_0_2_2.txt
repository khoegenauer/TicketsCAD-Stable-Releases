==============================================================

The EMD Card Set is designed to integrate with the Tickets CAD Program. The EMD Card Set is an Adobe Acrobat file that consists of a series of hyperlinks to the various cards in the set. To use the EMD Cards with Tickets, simply copy the "Tickets EMD Cards Version 2.6.pdf" file to the "/tickets/cards/" directory.

Note: We have withdrawn the basic document from availability in order to comply with a legal request that we do so, that request citing a claimed proprietary interest in its contents.

Nonetheless, you are encouraged to place here your agency's own version of that Card set.

This is the first draft set of the Emergency Medical Dispatch section of the Cards project. As with any medical product or device, these protocols are only offered as a suggestion. You should consult with your local medical director, state regulatory office or other regulating body before using any of these protocols. They come with no
guarantee as to the soundness, quality or accuracy of the protocols.

The cards are based on the recommendations of the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Several different formats were studied in the creation of these card sets, and what we felt were the best ideas being incorporated into this set.1 However, this is not set in stone.

Unlike other EMD protocol card sets, you can modify these to meet the needs of your agency. This EMD protocol set is released under the Creative Common license. Under the license for this protocol set, you can modify the protocols, create as many copies as you like and share the protocols with others. You are not allowed to sell them. You should make sure that The Open ISES Project is noted as the original author of the protocols. If you modify them you should also note that as well.

When in use, the cards are read from top to bottom, with the Key Questions being asked first, then the proper dispatch code (Red or Yellow), followed by pre-arrival instructions to be given to the caller. There are Call-taker prompts to reinforce certain actions, and a short dispatch guide.

These cards are presented as a guide to help your agency get started in providing EMD services. Your agency must decide what questions to maintain, what questions to change. Your agency must decide how you wish to respond based on the answers you receive from the caller.

If you have any comments or suggestions concerning this card set, please drop us a line and let us know. Our goal is to make The Cards Project useful to as many PSAPs as possible. We can only do that through your help.
